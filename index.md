## Data Science Portfolio of Dr Khairul Afzan Bin Aziz

As a data scientist, I am passionate about helping SMEs or entrepreneurs use data to answer a few questions that affect their industry:

1. What information is most important to their business mission?
2. What information is changing?
3. What factors affect the information?

Although there are many reasons to use data analytics, these questions need to be answered to meet two main reasons that are the bread and butter of a business:

1. To increase revenue
2. To reduce cost

Below are examples of how to analyze and present data:
